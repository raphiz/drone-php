# PHP Images for drone.io CI
Drone requires git to be installed in an image. The standart PHP images do not come with git 
installed.
The goal of this project is to extend the existing images and install git.

Note that only a very small subset of all PHP versions are supported - feel free to contribute 
if you need one that does not yet exist.
